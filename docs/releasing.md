# Release contract

starter-websocket releases are ordinary Go module tags plus a small, independently
verifiable artifact set. The repository owns the complete build. No external
release build service, mutable workspace snapshot, or network-resolved package
list participates in artifact construction.

For `v1.2.3`, the release builder produces:

| Artifact | Contract |
|---|---|
| `starter-websocket_1.2.3_source.tar.gz` | Exact tagged Git commit, under one versioned directory |
| `starter-websocket_1.2.3_sbom.spdx.json` | SPDX 2.3 packages from the consistent committed `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `vendor/modules.txt` graph |
| `checksums.txt` | SHA-256 of the source archive and SBOM, sorted by filename |
| `checksums.txt.sig` | Raw Ed25519 signature of the exact checksum bytes |
| `checksums.txt.pem` | X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo PEM for signature verification |

The source archive is reconstructed from the full commit's `git ls-tree`
identity and exact object bytes read through `git cat-file --batch`. It never
uses checkout filters or `git archive`, so `core.autocrlf` and host line-ending
settings cannot alter an artifact. Every tar and gzip timestamp is the source
commit epoch; paths are relative, ownership is zeroed, executable modes and
validated symlinks are preserved, and gzip output is deterministic. Gitlinks
and unsupported modes fail closed. Dirty or untracked workspace files cannot
enter the archive. The SBOM creation time uses the same epoch and contains no
absolute checkout path. Construction fails when committed module selection,
checksums, and vendored versions or replacements disagree; the builder does
not rely on an earlier verifier to detect a stale dependency graph.

## Protected production ceremony

The pinned central workflow validates the exact canonical tag and commit,
repeats `make verify-release` without credentials, renders deterministic
artifacts, signs them, and passes them to a separate verifier before publishing.
No repository-local release builder exists. The immutable central renderer is
the sole production implementation.

This repository's reviewed public Ed25519 trust anchor is committed at
`security/release/ed25519-public.pem`. Its SHA-256 fingerprint over the DER
SubjectPublicKeyInfo bytes is
`58d664089f3cb42262e491ed1a9e0c30b0f5d3722571f8f74c144afee55882b0`.
Store only the matching private key as the repository Actions secret
`SPICE_LIBRARY_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY`. Configure protected `release-signing` and
`release-publish` environments for the signing approval and write-capable final
job. Both environments should require the repository's designated reviewers.

Do not create or push a release tag until the matching private signing secret
and both protected environments are configured. Committing the public anchor
does not assert that those controls, a tag, or a release exist. The caller
forwards exactly one explicitly named signing secret; broad `secrets: inherit`
forwarding is forbidden. The reusable workflow references that secret only in
its protected `release-signing` job. Validation, planning, independent
verification, and publishing cannot read it. The workflow fails closed on a
missing key, an anchor mismatch, a moved tag, or independent verification
failure.

## Unsigned deterministic rehearsal

The library module authorizes an exact central renderer through its
`go.mod` tool directive. `make release-rehearsal` asks that fully qualified tool
for one read-only plan, then renders the same plan twice with `GOWORK=off`,
`GOPROXY=off`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, and `GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor`:

```text
make release-rehearsal
```

Both renders are unsigned and always archive `HEAD`, never working-tree
contents. Every artifact must be byte-identical, the checksum file must
canonically authenticate its archive and SBOM, the SPDX document must carry
the renderer/v1 provenance, and neither output may contain a signature or
public key. The gate fails closed on an extra artifact, dependency drift,
malformed checksum, provenance drift, or nondeterministic output.

`make verify-release` executes this deterministic rehearsal after the complete
repository verification contract.

## Consumer verification

With OpenSSL 3 and GNU-compatible checksum tooling:

```text
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey checksums.txt.pem \
  -rawin -in checksums.txt -sigfile checksums.txt.sig
```

Consumers must authenticate the signature with the reviewed committed
`security/release/ed25519-public.pem`, not an untrusted key downloaded beside
the release. The central signer refuses a private key that does not match that
anchor, and the independent verifier authenticates the complete artifact set
before the protected publish job receives it.
